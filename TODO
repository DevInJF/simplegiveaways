            Schedule a job to downgrade the user's subscription in our db at the end of the cycle (will already be updated in Stripe).

      ☐ If you update to a higher plan, we will create a new invoice for the prorated charges and bill you immediately.

      ☐ If you cancel, we will try to associate your page with another active subscription from another user (if possible).

      ☐ If a user's plan is scheduled to change or be cancelled, make sure messaging reflects this.

          Example: "You are currently subscribed to SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN.name.  Your plan will be changed to NEW_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN.name after ACTIVATE_NEXT_AFTER. or Your plan will be cancelled after ACTIVATE_NEXT_AFTER. or Your plan will be renewed on CURRENT_PERIOD_END."

 ☐ Don't mark completed, giveaways which have not been started b/c of scheduling conflict or lack of subscription.

 ☐ Just warn unsubscribed user that his giveaway won't be automatically started.  Don't force a subscription.
