      5) User-centric subscriptions page.

        a) Subscribe

        b) Cancel subscription
          If you cancel, you will not receive a refund. You will just not be reupped at the end of the billing cycle.

        c) Update subscription
          If you update to a higher plan, your plan will be prorated.  If you update to a lower plan, you will not be refunded. The new plan will start at the end of the cycle.

          - Might need to consider hybrid subscription (single page yearly / multi page monthly) but not sure yet.

      6) Open start giveaway modal when a user is referred back after successful subscription.

      7) Confirm graph dates are correct.

      8) Confirm subscriptions with Stripe callbacks.
